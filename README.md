## Machine Learning for Real-time Diagnostics of Cold Atmospheric Plasma Soruces

This repository includes the data and the code relating to results presented in the [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332427621_Machine_Learning_for_Real-time_Diagnostics_of_Cold_Atmospheric_Plasma_Sources). Each Jupyter notebook corresponds to one of the case studies investigated in detail in the paper using the datasets described below.

### Datasets

**dat_test.csv** - optical emission spectra for the N2 second positive transition, fitted rotational and vibrational temperatures and operating conditions (power, flow, substrate type) compiled into comma seperated values file

**dat_test_dsep.csv** - optical emission spectra for the N2 second positive transition, fitted rotational and vibrational temperatures and operating conditions (power, flow, substrate type, seperation distance) compiled into comma seperated values file

**dat_test_o2.csv** - optical emission spectra for the N2 second positive transition, fitted rotational and vibrational temperatures and operating conditions (power, flow, substrate type, additive o2 concentration (%) compiled into comma seperated values file

**dat_test_pull.csv** - optical emission spectra for the N2 second positive transition, fitted rotational and vibrational temperatures and operating conditions (power, flow, substrate type) recorded as glass substrate pulled from under the APPJ
